# RGBA Converter 

Working example here https://vinothkumar1010.github.io/rgbaconverter/

Created to convert Hexa decimal value to RGBA value

- When working in fun project with flutter come to know that we have to use RGBA value
- Searched in the google found I have to create new class or add code for that
- ✨Magic ✨
- Created this to convert easily by selecting color or providing Hexa value
